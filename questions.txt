Here are some questions for my good computer geek genius friends:

- I have now a file called .py which it wont open on jupyter notebook the same way as before. Can I have an extension that makes me use it on the jupyter notebook?
- On vim, I have comments as the same colour as some other commands. Can I change it to make it more distinguishable?
- I cannot get rid of questions file with swp extention on git.
